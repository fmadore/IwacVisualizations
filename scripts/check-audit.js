// Quality job's later steps, so a red audit was hiding the generated-artifact
// check behind it. Turning the gate off would have hidden the next real one.
//
// So this fails on any high or critical advisory not listed in
// scripts/lib/audit-exceptions.js, and on any listed one that has stopped
// needing the exception: npm can now fix it in range, or it no longer appears.
